## BASIC

* nascom.basic.grant.searle : backup of NASCOM BASIC adapted by Grant Searle on his homebrew computer as found on http://searle.x10host.com/z80/SimpleZ80.html
(it's also the base software for RC2014 project)
* original : for reference NASCOM BASIC without modifications
* basic.asm : Grant Searle's version with small modifications by me (skip memory test, add colors)
* basic_boot.asm : the glue between basic.asm and the computer, with memory
